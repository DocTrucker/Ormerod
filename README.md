This repository was been initially cloned from RepRapPro's repository for the 
Ormerod 2 printer. I am predominantly using this as a learning exercise but
hope in the short term to rebuild the PLA kit parts with PETG and resize a few
to reduce the stress fractures that I've experienced with a recent (old) kit 
build. My objectives are different to that of RepRapPro, therefore my ideals 
are different to their ideals. The changes I have made are not to be
interpreted as correcting mistakes, merely working to a different set of goals 
with completely different financial, engineering, and business pressures.

The work here is currently in stage one. I am currently reverse engineering 
the presented STL files into parametric FreeCAD files. My plan is as follows:

1. Re-engineer existing STL files back into a parametric FreeCAD format.
2. Build a basic assembly model to ensure the files are fit fort purpose.
3. Design parts as needed to incorporate an E3D V6 hot end and Bondtech
   Extruder.
4. Build these parts and assemble the first iteration of my take on the
   Ormerod 2.
5. Make the first release of files at this stage.
6. Carry out a written review of the parts and establish objectives to be 
   achieved before the next release.
7. Execute the changes with a modifications categorised into reliability,
   part quality, one off build cost, design for ease of build, and/or build 
   rate.
8. Following release.

I expect that I will move onto a different design of machine after stage 8.

For more information see: https://reprappro.com/shop/reprap-kits/ormerod-2-kit/

Files in this directory were produced in SolidWorks 2015, and is the full assembly for the Ormerod 2. Some components that are shared with our other printers may be found in our "Library" repository.

The 'STLs' directory contains STLs of the printed parts. Instructions for printing parts for Ormerod 2, and a reference - itemising part numbers, descriptions and required quantities - may be found in the Ormerod instructions, here: https://reprappro.com/documentation/ormerod-2/#Printing_parts_for_Ormerod_2

The 'dxf' folder contains the parts in a format for laser cutting.
